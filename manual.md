- ## Headings

    ##### To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. 

    *Example 1*
        
        # Heading level 1       
    
    *Result:* 
    # Heading level 1
    
    *Example 2*
    
        #### Heading level 4  

    *Result:*  
    #### Heading level 1

    **Note:** *Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.*
